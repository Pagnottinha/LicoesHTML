            all I ever wanted to do was do right things<br>
            I never wanted to be the king, <em>I swear</em><br>
            all I ever wanted to do was save your life<br>
            I never wanted to grab a knife, <em>I swear</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            tearless, fearless, burning, burning<br>
            you tell me what have I missed<br>
            still wandering in the deep mist

                if I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all<br>
                if I lose it all outside the wall<br>
                live to die another day<br>
                I don't want anything<br>

            all I ever wanted to do was know what's out there<br>
            I refused to lose without a fight<br>
            we're just too young, ignorant and innocent<br>
            like kids stay up all night in a tent<br>
            how do you see me?<br>
            am I who I used to be?<br>
