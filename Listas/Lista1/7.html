		<h3>Stephen - Crossfire</h3>

		<p>
			He'd trade his guns for love<br>
			But he's caught in the crossfire<br>
			And he keeps wakin' up<br>
			But it's not to the sound of birds
		</p>		

		<p>
			The tyranny<br>
			The violent streets<br>
			Deprived of all that we're blessed with<br>
			And we can't get enough, no
		</p>

		<p>
			Heaven, if you sent us down<br>
			So we can build a plague around<br>
			For the sinners<br>
			To play as saints<br>
			You'd be so proud of what we made
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope you got some beds around<br>
			'Cause you're the only refuge now<br>
			For every mother<br>
			Every child<br>
			Every brother<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire
		</p>

		<p>
			I'd trade my luck to know<br>
			Why he's caught in the crossfire<br>
			And I'm here wakin' up<br>
			To the sun and the sound of birds
		</p>

		<p>
			Society's anxiety<br>
			Deprived of all that we're blessed with<br>
			We just can't get enough, no
		</p>

		<p>
			Heaven, if you sent us down<br>
			So we can build a plague around<br>
			For the sinners<br>
			To play as saints<br>
			You'd be so proud of what we made
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope you got some beds around<br>
			'Cause you're the only refuge now<br>
			For every mother<br>
			Every child<br>
			Every brother<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire
		</p>

		<p>
			Can I trust what I'm given<br>
			When faith still needs a gun<br>
			Whose ammunition<br>
			Justifies the wrong?<br>
			And I can't see<br>
			From the backseat<br>
			So I'm asking from above<br>
			Can I trust what I'm given<br>
			Even when it cuts?
		</p>

		<p>
			So heaven if you sent us down<br>
			So we can build a plague around<br>
			For the sinners<br>
			To play as saints<br>
			You'd be so proud of what we made
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope you got some beds around<br>
			'Cause you're the only refuge now<br>
			For every mother<br>
			And every child<br>
			Every brother<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire<br>
			That's caught in the crossfire
		</p>

		<p>
			Who's caught in the crossfire<br>
			Who's caught on the crossfire baby, baby<br>
			Who's caught on the cross
		</p>
